## Inspiration
The world of social media can be very toxic these days, with humans spending too much time on social media! _ZuckSucks_ aims to make the Facebook experience unbearable to deter you from using the site, tackling your addiction to the platform.

## What it does
_ZuckSucks_ is a Chrome extension which modifies your Facebook feed to make the experience unbearable if you have been using the site too much! We use all the state-of-the-art techniques such as owoifying the text and adding CSS filters to the user interface to make the experience as headache inducing as possible!

## Challenges we ran into
There were a lot of nay-sayers along the way who said what we were doing was stupid! However we persisted and we feel like our product will change the Facebook experience for generations! We hope Facebook will consider implementing this into the platform by default for all users to enjoy!
